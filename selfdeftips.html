          <p>An interesting art that is immediately recognizable. It does have a few striking moves in it, but for the
            most part, it is based on the principle that when an attacker strikes, he leaves some part of his defense
            vulnerable. If you, the defender, do not attack him, you remain defensively invulnerable.Do not resist his
            attack. <br>Use its momentum against him.
            Steven Seagal is the most famous Aikido practitioner in the Western world. He may be a horrible actor,
            <br>but he is a genuine 7th degree black belt in Aikido, and his signature move is absolutely essential to
            any self-defense arsenal: the kote gaeshi, or “forearm return.”</p>

          <p class="py-4">Here, special emphasis is placed on attack deflection.Most punches or knife lunges are
            performed straight
            toward you, not in an arc. Few fighters are stupid enough to try a looping haymaker.
            <br><br>
            Thus, step to the side, creating a lateral line toward the attacker’s arm, strike the attacker’s punch or
            knife hand, then quickly strike his lower side, belly, or back with your other fist. This is very difficult
            to defend against, and most likely he will not be able to.
            Push forward and throw a knee into his quadriceps. This hurts like crazy.</p>

            grappling,
            hard striking, eye gouging, choke holds, biting, joint locks, as well as the awareness of the defender’s
            center of gravity versus the attacker’s center of gravity.You throw your attacker by lowering your center of
            gravity under his, and jerking him over you, or around you.<br> It’s simple and effective. If he attacks
            with a weapon, you trap this arm, then deliver a knife-hand strike to his collarbone, while shoving him
            backward and down, locking the weapon wrist and breaking it.</p>

          <p class="py-4">Wing Chun Kung Fu is the art that Yip Man taught to Bruce Lee, and which Lee rebelled against
            as too slow
            and formal for self-defense. That’s quite misleading. He meant that it was insufficient for him when
            fighting against professional martial art experts,
            like Wong Jack Man, with whom he fought a famous duel.<br>Lee invented his own version of Wing Chun, which
            became entry #5, because of the inadequacies he noticed in Wing Chun. With this method, he defeated Wong in
            3 minutes, when almost any other fighter in the world would have needed a lot more time, and would have
            suffered much more injury.</p>

          <p class="py-4">The Keysi Method has almost no kicks of any kind. It thrives on extreme close-quarters combat
            using every
            weapon the body can quickly wield in such a small space: fists, head, knees, and especially the elbows.
            There is only one stance to know, and when you see it one time, you can do it: <br>“the thinking man,” with
            the hands clasped on the head, and the elbows raised to protect the head, neck and upper chest. It looks
            like a man holding his head while deep in thought.
            It is designed to strike with the sharp elbows, and lots of hammer fists, which are MUCH more powerful and
            devastating than straight punches, because they employ the entire upper body in bringing the firm</p>

            boxing punches, Karate kicks and knees, Greco-Roman wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu ground fighting,
            Jiu-jitsu throws and grappling, and most importantly, “bursting,” adapted from Wing Chun. <br>This is a
            simultaneous defense/attack: instead of blocking an attack and then delivering a response, you block the
            attack and deliver a response at the same time, i. e., block with the left arm and push forward with the
            legs, striking with the right fist to the throat, all simultaneously.</p>
