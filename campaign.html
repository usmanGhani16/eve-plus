                        <p>Women have landed on the Moon, walked in space, been elected as Heads of States, they have
                            proved
                            themselves equal to men in every way, Yet they are not safe in their own immediate
                            surroundings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aggression and assault is a women's reality, crime against women is a daily occurrence, age,
                            class, qualification hold no significance. These attacks are all abuses of power, where the
                            attacker (mostly males) uses the act of violence to dominate and demonstrate power over the
                            attackees.</p>
                        <p>The sad reality is that we live in an increasingly violent society in which the fear of crime
                            is
                            ever present. Personal safety has become an issue of importance for everyone, especially
                            women.
                            To survive woman need to fight back.</p>
                        <p>
                            The first step towards effective self-defense is to realise no matter what, all of us are
                            susceptible to various forms of crime . And it is well documented that women of all ages
                            have
                            successfully defended themselves against male attackers.</p>
                        <p>
                            Eve teasing, sexual harassment, molestation, domestic, violence etc. no matter what the
                            statistics are, if you are being harassed or assaulted it will be 100%</p>
                        <h2>Campaign Ideas</h2>
                        <p>
                            The situation needs to be addressed and taking a step forward EvePlus is organising a series
                            of
                            workshop on "Basics of self defense" for adolescent girls and women as part of its Safety &
                            Awareness Campaign</p>

                        <p>In the first phase 5 workshops were organised in different communities with a total
                            participation
                            of over 500 women.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These sessions were conducted by experts from the Women cell of Pakistani police. And were
                            in
                            the form of lectures coupled with discussion and demonstration of a few basic self-defense
                            techniques</p>
                        <p>The objective of the workshops were be to make the participants aware of different situations
                            and
                            how to deal with them. Also covered were the topics of "Myths about women, violence and
                            self-defense", body language", "how to use everyday items as weapons and basics about the
                            redressal procedures and how to approach the police.</p>
                        <p>
                            In essence the workshops were a wake up call to the participants that:</p>
                        <p>'Never, never think that it couldn't happen to you!' Have a plan! Act Hard! Be prepared!</p>
                        <p>
                            Women have a right to their space.</p>
                        <p>Women have a right to their freedom and autonomyâ€¦ and must defend these rights</p>
                        <p>
                            The workshops highlighted the fact that it was absolutely essential that women/girls raise
                            their
                            voice against any misconduct and get the perpetrators to justice as it will not only teach
                            the
                            perpetrators a lesson but also act as a deterrent against them repeating the offense. The
                            idea
                            that one will be able to pick out a potential attacker by their appearance, age, class,
                            relation, gender, and what they do for a living is a mistake. The message loud and clear was
                            Gone are the days when girls were required to lower their gaze, walk straight and speak
                            softly,
                            the village for today is look up, be alert about what's happening around you and speak up
                            against injustice</p>
                        <p>The response to the workshops has been overwhelming and repeat/new workshops will be held in
                            the
                            old and new communities. The target is to cover at least 1200 girls/women.</p>
